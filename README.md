# MASPHL-Tuberculosis

## Overview
Analyses were conducted for the Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory's Mycobacteriology (Tuberculosis) Laboratory. The laboratory receives clinical isolates of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and related organisms for routine monitoring.

As the Microbiology Division's Research Analyst, I was responsible for cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing laboratory output such as test volumes, turnaround times, antibiotic resistance testing, and organism determination, as well as for communicating results to MASPHL and MassDPH personnel. 

## Major Projects
- _Internal Reporting_: Regular reporting of results for in-lab use. Summary of isolates received and results for the current year, updated monthly. Included test volumes, percent positivity, and turnaround times by organism, as well as detection of incomplete reports and isolates for which testing results were in conflict.
